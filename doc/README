Printing the documentation
==========================

You need the following programs to generate a printable file from the
LaTeX and FIG sources:

  - LaTeX
  - fig2dev from the transfig package (optional)

The LaTeX translations of the FIG files are already included in the
distribution, so you can print the documentation without fig2dev.
WARNING: 'make distclean'  removes those pre-built LaTeX files.

You can also omit all drawings by typing  make dummies . The drawings
are only necessary when processing the technical overview document.

To run LaTeX just type

  make

LaTeX issues many "Overfull \hbox" warnings. They can be safely ignored.
LaTeX will be run repeatedly until it stops issuing the message
LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references 
right.

At the end you should get the very old documentation in user.pdf and 
tech.pdf.

Generating user.README
======================

Use the simple tool t2a.pl for converting to ASCII formatted (old) user
documentation:

  perl t2a.pl  <user.tex  >user.README

Online documentation
====================

The (old) documentation can also be found in the web:
